                    <p>Craft beer is exploding in America. No longer is your only choice at a restaurant or bar some watery macro brew such as Bug Light or Coors. Today, at most restaurants, you have a wide slection of craft beers to choose from from wide variety of beer styles. There are even stores opening who soley specialize in craft beers (example: <a href="http://beerrun.com/")> Beer Run</a>).</p>
                    <p>With so many beers out there (and new ones appearing every day) it is getting hard for beer enthusiasts to keep track of what beers they've had. No one wants to order what they think is a new beer and find out that they've already had it. Or even worse order a beer they later remember they hated. There is a huge demand for a system to track craft beer consumption </p>
                    <p>This website is intended for craft beer enthusiasts who want to keep track of what beers they have tasted. It will be able to log when and where the beer was had and the drinkers opinion of the beer. </p>
